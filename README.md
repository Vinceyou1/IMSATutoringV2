## Welcome to IMSA Tutoring!

This is my repository for the IMSA Tutoring website. I started this project in the summer of 2023 to connect peer tutors and other students at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. <br/><br/>
This web app works by allowing tutors to input their shifts, which students can then look up to book appointments based on school subject, class, and/or residence hall. Once an appointment is booked, emails are automatically sent to both the student and tutor to confirm the appointment. <br/> <br/>
I was eventually able to deploy my app to 600+ students and ~50 tutors!
