Apart from chess, I'm involved in numerous other student organizations, including Mu Alpha Theta, Society of Engineers, and Junior Class Club. I'm incredibly passionate about math and computer science, and hope to major in the latter. I've also traveled to India 7 times in my life, as my parents lived there for the majority their lives.
